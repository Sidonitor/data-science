# Predicting Crop Yields with Machine Learning: A Comparative Study Using Environmental and Soil-Based Datasets

This repository contains my paper "Predicting Crop Yields with Machine Learning: A Comparative Study Using Environmental and Soil-Based Datasets" which was submitted to the data-science course at the Technical University of Applied Sciences Augsburg.

It also contains all the code used to generate the results in the paper. The code is written in Jupyter Notebooks.

Based on the following datasets:

Abstract: \
*Crop yield prediction is a critical task in modern
agriculture, with implications for food security, resource optimization,
and sustainable farming practices. This study evaluates
the predictive power of three distinct datasets: Agriculture Crop
Yield, a synthetic dataset focused on environmental variables;
Crop Yield Prediction Dataset, a real-world dataset emphasizing
meteorological factors; and Crop Yield Prediction, which combines
soil properties with environmental data. Using automated
machine learning (AutoML) techniques through the AutoGluon
framework, the datasets were analyzed for feature importance
and prediction accuracy. Key findings revealed that rainfall was
a dominant predictor in the synthetic dataset, while crop type
and region were most influential in the real-world dataset. Soil
properties such as nitrogen and potassium played a significant
role in the soil-focused dataset. The study highlights the strengths
and limitations of these datasets, emphasizing the need for diverse
data sources to improve model robustness and applicability.
Future work should explore the integration of complementary
datasets, advanced modeling techniques, and temporal data to
further enhance prediction capabilities.*
